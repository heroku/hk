## Background

This package provides a complete interface to all of the Heroku Platform API v3
actions, and is almost entirely auto-generated based on the API's JSON Schema.
The exceptions are the files `heroku.go`, `heroku_test.go`, and `app_test.go`,
as well as the generator itself. All models are auto-generated by the Ruby
script in `gen/gen.rb`.

The client leverages Go's powerful `net/http` Client. That means that,
out-of-the-box, it has keep-alive support and the ability to handle many
concurrent requests from different goroutines.

## Installation

This package is targeted towards Go 1.2 or later, though it may work on
earlier versions as well.

Run `go get github.com/bgentry/heroku-go` to download, build, and install the
package.

## Getting Started

To use the client, first add it to your Go file's imports list:

```go
import (
  "github.com/bgentry/heroku-go"
)
```

Then create a Client object and make calls to it:

```go
client := heroku.Client{Usernam: "email@me.com", Password: "my-api-key"}
app, err := client.AppCreate(nil)
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}
fmt.Println("Created", app.Name)
```

That's it! Here is a more advanced example that also sets some options on the
new app:

```go
name := "myapp"
region := "region"

// optional values need to be pointers
opts := heroku.AppCreateOpts{Name: &name, Region: &region}
app2, err := client.AppCreate(opts) // Create an app with options set
if err != nil {
  // if this is a heroku.Error, it will contain details about the error
  if hkerr, ok := err.(heroku.Error); ok {
    panic(fmt.Sprintf("Error id=%s message=%q", hkerr.Id, hkerr))
  }
}
fmt.Printf("created app2: name=%s region=%s", app2.Name, app2.Region.Name)

// Output:
// created app1: name=dodging-samurai-42 region=us
// created app2: name=myapp region=eu
```

## hk

Fast Heroku client.

### Overview

hk is a command line client to the Heroku runtime platform, designed to be as fast as possible.

#### Disclaimer

This is pre-alpha software. It will undergo substantial changes during the
coming months. Don't be surprised if it is broken or if the interface is
completely altered without warning.

Issues and pull requests are still welcome, but please understand that they may
be rejected if it's an issue we just aren't ready to tackle this early in the
project.

### Motivation

#### Fast as a feature

```bash
## version

$ time heroku version >/dev/null
real	0m1.813s

$ time hk version >/dev/null
real	0m0.016s

## list

$ time heroku apps >/dev/null
real	0m3.830s

$ time hk apps >/dev/null
real	0m0.785s
```

#### Focus on API

We believe this is evidence that a first-class Heroku API trumps any particular
client.

#### Iterative Development

A release mechanism was created for hk in the beginning: the binary updates
itself. This gives us confidence in iterative development, which we value
highly, because it gives us the ability to release very often knowing users will
see the updates in a timely manner.

#### The power of Go

hk demonstrates the power of the Go language, runtime, systems access, and
distribution story (a single, statically linked binary with no dependencies)
which are all very appealing to Heroku.

#### Unix

Heroku loves Unix. This client should reflect that. Commands are single,
unhyphenated words that map to their unix ancestorsâ€™ names and flags where
applicable.

### Installation

> Please note that versions of hk installed from source are unsupported and
> should only be installed for development purposes.

#### Mac OS X, Linux, BSD

Pre-built binaries are available for Mac OS X, Linux, and BSD. Once installed,
these binaries will automatically update themselves when new releases are
available.

To install a pre-built binary release, run the following one-liner:

```bash
$ L=/usr/local/bin/hk && curl -sL -A "`uname -sp`" https://hk.heroku.com/hk.gz | zcat >$L && chmod +x $L
```

The URL [https://hk.heroku.com/hk.gz](https://hk.heroku.com/hk.gz) will attempt
to detect your OS and CPU architecture based on the User-Agent, then redirect
you to the latest release for your platform.

#### Windows

Currently, you need to have a [Go development environment][go-install] to
install hk on Windows. Compiled binaries with automatic updating are available
for Windows, but the installer is not ready yet.

	$ go get github.com/heroku/hk

Again, note that this installation method is unsupported.

### netrc

You'll need a line like this in $HOME/.netrc

	machine api.heroku.com login <email> password <apitoken>

## Plugins

hk currently has a minimal plugin system. It may see substantial changes in the future, and those changes may break existing plugins or change the architecture at any time. Use this functionality at your own risk.

Plugins are executables located in HKPATH or, if HKPATH does not exist, in /usr/local/lib/hk/plugin. They are executed when hk does not know command X and an installed plugin X exists. The special case default plugin will be executed if hk has no command or installed plugin named X.

hk will set these environment variables for a plugin:

* HEROKU_API_URL - The url containing the username, password, and host to the api endpoint.
* HKAPP - The app as determined by the git heroku remote, if available.
* HKUSER - The username from either HEROKU_API_URL or .netrc
* HKPASS - The password from either HEROKU_API_URL or .netrc
* HKHOST - The hostname for the API endpoint

### Development

hk requires Go 1.2 or later and uses [Godep](https://github.com/kr/godep) to manage dependencies.

	$ cd hk
	$ vim main.go
	$ godep go build
	$ ./hk apps

### Release

	$ cd hk
	$ vim main.go # edit Version
	$ godep go build
